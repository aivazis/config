# Revision 1.5  2000/09/15 01:31:29  cummings
# Switched C++ compiler for this target from the GNU compiler
# to the native HP compiler aCC.  I am now able to build a
# 64-bit version of vtf3d-el.exe on the HP V-class machine
# using the three HP compilers.  Because I switched to using
# 64-bit compilation, it will be non-trivial to switch this
# target back to using the g++ compiler.  I plan to introduce
# support in the build system for selecting 64-bit or 32-bit
# compilation in the near future.  Anyway, using the native
# compiler should result in better code performance.
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/09/14 18:55:21  cummings
# Changed target C++ compiler designation from gnu-2.95 to gcc-2.95.2,
# since gnu-2.95 compiler target has been removed.  Also added HPaCC
# compiler target, but it is commented out for now, since this compiler
# has troubles compiling cpt.
