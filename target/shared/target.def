# Revision 1.4  2000/09/12 21:10:43  cummings
# Removed the lines which added flag for building a shared object
# to the set of target-specific link-time flags.  We need to keep
# this flag separate from the others and only introduce it when
# we want to build a shared object (rather than an executable).
# The user can distinguish the build of a shared object from that
# of an executable by adding the appropriate "SOFLAGS" macro to
# his or her link command line.
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/09/05 04:54:43  aivazis
# Removed the redefinition of AR_UPDATE to permit the construction of
# archives of PIC object modules.
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/08/30 02:14:35  cummings
# Override definition of EXT_LIB and AR_UPDATE macros for shared library
# filename extension and appropriate archiving command.
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/08/25 01:44:58  cummings
# Added definitions file for new target "shared", which simply adds the
# SOFLAGS to the compile and link command lines.  There probably should
# also be a EXT_LIB defined, so that this target can change that to the
# appropriate suffix for a shared library (normally .so).
#
#

#
# Here are the target-specific flags 
#
# C
#
    TARGET_CC_FLAGS += $(CC_SOFLAGS)
#
# C++
#
    TARGET_CXX_FLAGS += $(CXX_SOFLAGS)
#
# FORTRAN
#
    TARGET_F77_FLAGS += $(F77_SOFLAGS)
#
# Shared Library 
#
    EXT_LIB = $(EXT_SAR)
