# Since both insure and tau need to turn off the use of combined
# makedepends/compilation, I created a new build procedure macro
# called NO_MAKEDEPENDS_COMBINED.  If this macro is defined, we do
# not do makedepends and compilation in one combined step.  We define
# this macro here and in the tau definitions file.
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/03/05 01:43:46  rapa
# added -Zsl (recommended by insure at link time)
#
# Revision 1.4  1999/07/15 23:05:55  mga
# It is not necessary anymore to auto-include debug.def.
#     Use "TARGET=insure,debug mm" if you want good stack traces
#
# Revision 1.3  1999/07/01 05:15:41  aivazis
# Accept comma separated list of targets in TARGET
#
# Revision 1.2  1999/06/21 03:06:32  aivazis
