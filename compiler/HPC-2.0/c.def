# Revision 1.15  2001/03/31 00:21:59  cummings
# Following Raul's suggestion, I have set the dependency file
# generation command for the HP C compiler to be "gcc -MM".
# We use gcc here because the HP C compiler does not have an
# option for doing dependency info generation.  This should
# fix the problem of the build system not rebuilding after
# changes to C header files on HP platforms.
#
# Revision 1.14  2001/01/30 01:39:52  cummings
# Replaced hard-wired 64-bit compile option with flag
# set by choosing either 32bit or 64bit target.
#
# Revision 1.13  2000/09/22 17:45:51  aivazis
# Removed non-sensical flags from FORSHARED
#
# Revision 1.12  2000/09/15 01:24:58  cummings
# Set compiler flag to +DA2.0W for consistency with other
# HP compilers.  Corrected flag for compiling position-independent
# code.  Took out some very fine-grained optimization flag
# settings (which should probably go into developer-specific
# definition files instead) and set optimization to +O2 for
# consistency with the other HP compilers.  Added profiling flag.
# Set depends command to mm_dummy, since there is apparently no
# capability in the C compiler to generate make dependencies.
# Added correct setting for producing shared objects with the
# HP C compiler.
#
# Revision 1.11  2000/09/12 23:47:20  cummings
# Changed LIBDIR to BLD_LIBDIR.
#
# Revision 1.10  2000/08/21 18:19:21  aivazis
# Added FORSHARED from gnu autoconfig. Will need tweaking.
# Removed the mixed language section
#
# Revision 1.9  2000/05/17 23:37:26  aivazis
# Major update in the way defines and include paths are handled
#
# Revision 1.8  2000/04/17 16:48:15  sharon
# modified compilation flags
#
# Revision 1.7  2000/03/02 01:39:05  rapa
# changed some flags following Sharon's suggestions
#
# Revision 1.6  1999/07/01 05:29:29  aivazis
# Optimization flag is -O; -O2 is not supported
#
# Revision 1.5  1999/06/30 21:57:33  aivazis
# Removed MPI-specific hacks. Users must now include MPI/default.def
# in their makefiles to get MPI
#
# Revision 1.4  1999/06/24 22:18:12  aivazis
