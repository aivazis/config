Build Procedure Documentation
</H2>

<H3>
Introduction
</H3>

<P>
This document describes the structure and usage of the build procedure
that compiles and links our ASCI code projects and other packages
that they depend on.  The build procedure is designed to make our codes
easily portable to a very wide variety of compiler and platform targets.
Furthermore, it allows for customization of the compilation process
at several different levels.

<P>
The core of the build procedure is embodied in the shell script <EM>mm</EM>.
Code packages are built and installed by invoking this script, which
automatically determines the host target, locates the appropriate compiler
commands and options for this target platform, and issues the necessary
commands to build the code packages.  The mm script relies on a layered 
set of definition files that customize behavior and recursive processing
of makefiles that describe a package and any subpackages it may contain.

<H3>
The mm Script
</H3>

<P>
The mm script is meant to be used in a manner similar to the standard
<EM>make</EM> tool.  mm is invoked in the following way:

<PRE>
mm [-f &lt;makefile&gt;] [target]
</PRE>

The <TT>-f</TT> option allows a code package to use makefiles with a
different name other than the default name, which is <TT>Make.mm</TT>.
If any <TT>target</TT> is specified, then mm will build that target
rather than the default target given by the makefiles.

<P>
Before we can properly use the mm script, we must set three environment 
variables:

<UL>
<LI>BLD_ROOT --- path of the root of the build tree
<LI>EXPORT_ROOT --- path of the root of the products tree
<LI>TARGET --- comma-delineated list of desired compilation options
</UL>

The source code for any package to be built using the build procedure
is typically stored in a directory below the common root <TT>BLD_ROOT</TT>.
(The files for the build system itself are also assumed to be located beneath
this common root directory in <TT>$BLD_ROOT/config</TT>, although this can
be overridden by setting the environment variable <TT>BLD_CONFIG</TT> to a
different path.)  Product libraries and binaries are built in subdirectories
<TT>lib</TT> and <TT>bin</TT> beneath <TT>$BLD_ROOT</TT>.  Once a code 
package has been built, we can use the make target <TT>export</TT> to install 
it in a directory below <TT>EXPORT_ROOT</TT>.  The contents of <TT>TARGET</TT>
indicate any special compile options.  (These targets are not to be confused 
with the make targets, which are defined within the makefiles of a code 
package in the standard way.)  The current valid target options for mm are

<UL>
<LI>debug --- compile with debugging on
<LI>opt --- compile with optimization on
<LI>insure --- instrument code with Insure++ code checking tool
<LI>purify --- link with Purify memory analysis libraries
<LI>prof --- generate extra code to write profiling information
<LI>mpi --- include MPI header and library files
</UL>

<P>
When mm is invoked, it will first check for the existence of the directories
indicated by <TT>BLD_ROOT</TT> and <TT>EXPORT_ROOT</TT>.  Next, it uses the
<TT>uname</TT> utility to determine the operating system and machine type.
This information is later used to select a platform-specific definitions file,
which indicates what compilers and standard options to use.  Once this is 
done, mm parses the contents of <TT>TARGET</TT> and looks for corresponding 
target-specific definitions files.  These files contain the special flags 
and definitions that are needed for these compilation options.  In addition,
a <EM>target tag</EM> is constructed by combining the name of the target
platform with any user-specified targets, and this tag is later used to
create target-specific subdirectories where the code package will be built.
This allows the build system to simultaneously maintain builds of a code 
package for many different potential targets.  The final setup step is to
get the user's name and check for any user-specific file of definitions 
which may override the standard settings and behaviors.

<P>
With all of these preliminaries completed, the actual work of processing the
make command begins.  mm checks for the <TT>-f</TT> option and changes the 
name of the code package makefile it will look for if requested.  If the 
environment variable <TT>LOGTAGS</TT> is set, mm will echo the makefile name
and the selected platform and user targets.  Finally, mm invokes <TT>make</TT>
on the makefile <TT>std-make.def</TT> and passes along the target (if any)
from the <TT>mm</TT> command line.  The special makefile <TT>std-make.def</TT>
coordinates the inclusion of all the various platform-specific, 
compiler-specific, target-specific and user-specific definitions files that
set options for the build system.

<H3>
Definitions Files
</H3>

<P>
The build system contains several sets of definitions files with a 
<TT>.def</TT> extension.  These files set the values of various macros that
control the behavior of the build system.  <TT>std-make.def</TT>, located in
directory <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/make</TT>, is the primary file which includes all
the other definitions files.  It first includes several other files from the
same directory that provide some default settings.  These files set up things
such as the standard names for certain Unix tools and standard filename 
extensions.  They also initialize with no value many compiler- and 
project-specific macros that may be overridden in other definitions files.
After this, <TT>std-make.def</TT> includes all of the target-specific 
definitions files, which are located within <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/target</TT>.
In this directory are subdirectories named after the possible targets
(both platform targets and user-specified targets), each containing a
<TT>target.def</TT> definitions file.  For user-specific targets like debug, 
the definitions file merely adds the correct flags to the list of 
target-specific compiler options.  For the various platform targets,
such as Linux-2.0_x86, this file sets macros indicating the platform we
are building on and the default compilers we will use for Fortran, C, and C++.
The platform name is used to locate and include a definitions file 
<TT>platform.def</TT> from beneath the directory <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/platform</TT>
that sets any platform-specific compiler or linker flags.  The compiler 
names are used to locate and include files <TT>f77.def</TT>, <TT>c.def</TT>
and <TT>cpp.def</TT> from beneath the directory <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/compiler</TT>,
which set up any compiler-specific flags that are needed.  (The user-specific
definitions file, if present in <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/make</TT>, is included just
prior to the compiler-specific files, so that the user can override the 
default compiler choices for this platform.)

<P>
Once all of these various macros have been defined, <TT>make</TT> is 
directed to include the local makefile for the current code package being 
built, which is normally called <TT>Make.mm</TT>.  This local makefile
should define macros which include what source files are to be compiled
and what libraries or binaries need to be built.  The contents of the 
local makefile will be discussed in the next section.  After the 
local makefile for the code package has been processed, <TT>std-make.def</TT>
includes more definitions files from <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/make</TT>.  These files
give the build rules for compiling Fortran, C and C++ source code files,
archiving object files into libraries, and linking application codes.  These
build rules are written in terms of all the macros that were defined earlier.
In addition, there are definitions for many different standard make targets
in the files <TT>std-targets.def</TT> and <TT>std-test.def</TT>.  These 
targets do things such as create new directory structures, export code
package files, remove old files from previous builds, and print out 
information about the current build configuration.  All of these targets,
along with any make targets defined by the local makefile for the code
package, constitute the set of valid targets that can be passed as an
argument on the <TT>mm</TT> command line.

<H3>
The Local Makefile
</H3>

<P>
Each code package must provide a makefile or set of makefiles that tells
the build system what source code files are contained in this package and
what libraries or binary executables can be produced.  The mm script has
the ability to recursively invoke <TT>make</TT> commands within the current
directory and all subdirectories below it.  Thus, each local makefile should
describe the source files and potential products of the current directory
and provide a rule for recursing into any subdirectories.  As mentioned
earlier, the local makefile is normally named <TT>Make.mm</TT>, but this
choice can be overridden by setting the environment variable
<TT>LOCAL_MAKEFILE</TT> or using <TT>mm</TT> with the <TT>-f</TT> option.

<P>
There are several examples of local makefiles in <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/tests</TT>
that show how to construct a makefile for building a library or an
application code.  In general, the first thing to do in your <TT>Make.mm</TT>
file is include a project-specific definitions file (with a <TT>.def</TT>
filename extension).  This file can be used to set special behaviors for
this project, such as using certain compiler options or linking with
certain libraries.  The file <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/tests/local.def</TT> illustrates
how to do this.  The macros beginning with <TT>PROJ_</TT> are project-specific
settings.  For each compiler (Fortran, C, and C++), there are macros that
add compiler flags, <TT>-D</TT> options to define macros for the preprocessor,
<TT>-I</TT> options for adding directories to the include file search path,
linker flags, and <TT>-L</TT> options for adding directories to the library
file search path.  (Note that for the macro defines, include file paths,
and library file paths, the <TT>-D</TT>, <TT>-I</TT>, or <TT>-L</TT> will
be prepended automatically, so they do not need to be included here.  Hence,
setting <TT>PROJ_CC_DEFINES = FOO</TT>, for example, will add the flag 
<TT>-DFOO</TT> to all C compilation commands for this project.)  This file 
can also be used to define the library (<TT>PROJ_LIB</TT>) and object files
(<TT>PROJ_OBJS</TT>) that are produced in this project, although this is 
typically done within the <TT>Make.mm</TT> file itself.  It is not necessary
to include a project-specific definitions file if nothing special is required
for this project; this is merely another degree of freedom for customizing
the build procedure for each project.

<P>
After including any project-specific definitions, the local makefile should
define its make targets, which at the bare minimum includes the default 
make target <TT>all</TT>.  Let us look at the <TT>Make.mm</TT> file in
directory <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/tests/projlib</TT> as an example.  The purpose of
this makefile is to compile a C source file and a C++ source file into
object files and archive these two object files into a library.  We first
define the macro <TT>PROJECT</TT> to be the name of our project (in this
case, <TT>test</TT>).  Next we define <TT>PROJ_LIB</TT> to be the name of
the library we are building here.  We make use of the macros <TT>LIBDIR</TT>
and <TT>EXT_AR</TT>, which were previously defined by the build system in 
file <TT>std-macros.def</TT>.  <TT>LIBDIR</TT> is the full path of the 
directory where libraries are built, and <TT>EXT_AR</TT> is set to <TT>a</TT>,
the extension for a static library on Unix systems.  Note that the value
of <TT>LIBDIR</TT> uses the macro <TT>TARGET_TAG</TT>, so that versions
of a library for different targets are placed in separate subdirectories.
After <TT>PROJ_LIB</TT>, we set <TT>PROJ_SRCS</TT> equal to the list of 
source code files that are to be compiled into the library.  This is
converted into a list of object files <TT>PROJ_OBJS</TT> by a definition
in <TT>std-builds.def</TT> that changes the filename extension of each file
to the value of <TT>EXT_OBJ</TT>, which is normally <TT>o</TT> on Unix 
file systems.  (The list <TT>PROJ_OBJS</TT> actually contains the library 
filename followed by each object filename in parentheses, which tells 
<TT>make</TT> to consider the timestamp of each object file within the 
library archive separately when checking dependencies.)  

<P>
In this example, we have source files <TT>c_hello.c</TT> and 
<TT>cpp_hello.cc</TT> being compiled into a library.  Each file is 
recognized as a source code file by its filename extension, with the 
supported extensions being defined in <TT>std-macros.def</TT>.  As usual,
these conventions for filename extensions can be overridden by redefining
the appropriate macros in a user-specific or project-specific definitions
file.  The files <TT>std-fortran.def</TT>, <TT>std-c.def</TT> and
<TT>std-cpp.def</TT> contain make rules for compiling Fortran, C and C++
source code files and adding the resulting object files to a library 
archive.  Note that these files also define macros which gather up all
of the compiler flags and options from any definitions files specific to
the current platform, compiler, target, user or project, and pass them
all on to the appropriate compiler or archiver command.

<P>
Next in this sample <TT>Make.mm</TT> file are definitions of the macros
<TT>PROJ_CLEAN</TT> and <TT>PROJ_DISTCLEAN</TT>.  The build system 
definitions file <TT>std-targets.def</TT> defines make targets <TT>clean</TT>
and <TT>distclean</TT> which remove the files specified by <TT>PROJ_CLEAN</TT>
and <TT>PROJ_DISTCLEAN</TT>.  Typically, we use the command <TT>mm clean</TT>
to remove products previously built using this makefile and the command
<TT>mm distclean</TT> to remove all files created during previous builds
(including dependency files, for example).  Thus, we have in this example
defined <TT>PROJ_CLEAN</TT> to be <TT>PROJ_LIB</TT>, the library produced 
by this makefile.  <TT>PROJ_DISTCLEAN</TT> is set equal to 
<TT>PROJ_DEPENDENCIES</TT>, which is defined by <TT>std-builds.def</TT> to
contain the list of <TT>PROJ_SRCS</TT> with the <TT>EXT_DEPEND</TT> extension 
appended to each filename.

<P>
At last, we get to the key definition of the make target <TT>all</TT>.  This
is the default target that will be built when we invoke <TT>mm</TT> with no
target specified on the command line.  In this case, our primary build target
is the <TT>PROJ_LIB</TT>, and the build system already has a rule for how
to build this in <TT>std-builds.def</TT>.  The rule will first echo to the
screen information about what library is being updated.  Then it will ensure
that the directory structure for building the library exists, creating it
if necessary.  Finally, it will build each of the items in <TT>PROJ_OBJS</TT>
and add it to the library archive using standard compiler and archiver 
commands.  Because of the way in which the dependencies have been arranged,
only source files that have been updated more recently than the corresponding
object file within the library archive are actually recompiled when rebuilding
an existing target.

<P>
This completes our description of the most basic local makefile required
for placing a code package under the build procedure.  To summarize, the
local makefile should define <TT>PROJ_LIB</TT> to be the full pathname
of the library that is the product of this package.  <TT>PROJ_SRCS</TT>
is a list of the local source code files to be compiled into this product 
library.  In addition, the makefile should define the make target <TT>all</TT>,
which is the default product built by the <TT>mm</TT> command.

<P>
Beyond these basics, there are several other actions that may be defined in 
<TT>Make.mm</TT> using the make targets in <TT>std-targets.def</TT>.  For 
example, one can create an <TT>export</TT> make target that will copy the
source code files and product library into a subdirectory under 
<TT>$EXPORT_ROOT</TT>.  The pre-defined make targets <TT>export-headers</TT> 
and <TT>export-libraries</TT> will copy over any files listed in the macros
<TT>EXPORTABLES</TT> and <TT>EXPORT_LIBS</TT>, respectively.  Another key
capability is recursion into subdirectories.  If a code package consists
of several subpackages, this can be handled using the <TT>recurse</TT> make
target.  This target will visit each of the subdirectories listed in
<TT>RECURSE_DIRS</TT> and invoke <TT>mm</TT> there with the target specified
by <TT>BLD_ACTION</TT>.  As an example, the definition

<PRE>
SUBPACKAGES = Foo Bar
clean::
        BLD_ACTION=&quot;clean&quot; RECURSE_DIRS=&quot;$(SUBPACKAGES)&quot; $(MM) recurse
</PRE>

would indicate that the command <TT>mm clean</TT> should execute not only in
the current directory, but also in the subdirectories <TT>Foo</TT> and 
<TT>Bar</TT>.  Using this recursion technique, we can construct libraries 
that require sources from multiple subpackages in a simple manner.  In
addition to the top-level <TT>Make.mm</TT> file, we create another
<TT>Make.mm</TT> file in each subdirectory that describes the local source
files that must be compiled in this directory.  This allows us to rebuild
modified source code files only in one directory or recursively below the 
current directory.

<P>
Finally, we should note that we have thus far only described the process
of compiling source code files and archiving the resulting object files
into libraries.  One can also define in <TT>Make.mm</TT> binary executable
targets which compile source code files and link them together with libraries
to form an executable.  There are examples of this in the <TT>Make.mm</TT>
file in <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/tests/mixed</TT>.  Notice how make targets such as
<TT>c_f77</TT> write the compile and link commands using macros from the
<TT>std-fortran.def</TT>, <TT>std-c.def</TT> and <TT>std-cpp.def</TT>
definition files.  This ensures that these executables will be built with
the same compilers and options as everything else in the build procedure.

<H3>
Summary
</H3>

Here is a list of the steps to take in order to use the build procedure
with a new code package:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the CVS module <TT>config</TT>, which contains the <TT>mm</TT>
script and all the basic definitions files for the build system (as well as
this documentation).
<LI>Set <TT>BLD_ROOT</TT> to the root directory for building product 
libraries and executables and <TT>EXPORT_ROOT</TT> to the root directory
for exporting header files and pre-built libraries or binaries.  Also
set <TT>BLD_CONFIG</TT> to the root directory for the build system files
if this is not the same as <TT>$BLD_ROOT/config</TT>.
<LI>Ensure that <TT>$BLD_CONFIG/make</TT> is in your <TT>PATH</TT> variable,
so that you can execute the <TT>mm</TT> script.
<LI>Create a local makefile for each directory within the directory structure
of your code package that contains header files to be exported and/or source
code files to be compiled into libraries or applications.
<LI>Set <TT>TARGET</TT> to a comma-delineated list of 
compilation targets such as debug compilation or linking with MPI.
<LI>Invoke <TT>mm</TT> to build the default target <TT>all</TT> or any other
make target defined in <TT>std-targets.def</TT> or the local makefile.
</UL>
