# The top-level makefile 
#
# Requires:
#
#   (o) A properly set make include path
#   (o) Valid definitions for the TARGET_xxx variables at the point of use
#   (o) LOCAL_MAKEFILE must point to the makefile in the directory in which we are building
#
# NYI: Add logic for project level settings
#      Add logic for high level settings, e.g.: --with-threads, --with-exceptions, etc.
