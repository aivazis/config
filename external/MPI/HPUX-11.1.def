# $Log: HPUX-11.1.def,v $
# Revision 1.10  2002/01/29 22:56:15  cummings
# Added -lclic_csi to MPI_LIBS.  This extra library is needed
# when using the new HP MPI 1.7.2 library which is now installed
# on the Superdome machine.
#
# Revision 1.9  2001/08/18 03:53:15  cummings
# Properly separated library search paths and libraries needed for MPI
# into MPI_LIBPATH and MPI_LIBS, respectively.
#
# Revision 1.8  2001/05/24 02:06:43  cummings
# Removed pmpi library because we don't use it.  Also, undid
# Michael's addition of the Csup library here.  This one is
# dangerous because when using the -AA flag with aCC for ANSI
# standard behavior, we already link with Csup_v2 automatically.
# We don't want two mutually incompatible versions of this
# standard library being linked in.  Michael, please let me
# know what problem was solved by adding -lCsup and I will find
# out if there is another way to solve the problem.
#
# Revision 1.7  2001/01/30 01:46:53  cummings
# Modified definition of MPI library search path to be
# customized for 32-bit or 64-bit.
#
# Revision 1.6  2000/09/19 23:12:06  aivazis
# Added libCsup to resolve a strange symbol
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/09/03 20:03:29  aivazis
# Use MPI_LIBDIR to get the right mpi librarues
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/08/23 05:16:36  aivazis
# Added NEEDS_MPI_HANDLE_FIXUP to flag the need for the MPI handle translation routines:
#     MPI_Comm_c2f, MPI_Group_c2f, MPI_Group_f2c, MPI_Op_c2f,
#     MPI_Op_f2c, MPI_Request_c2f, MPI_Request_f2c,
#     MPI_Status_c2f, MPI_Status_f2c, MPI_Type_c2f, MPI_Type_f2c
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/08/14 23:34:09  aivazis
# Uncommented out the library settings
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/05/31 20:50:14  sharon
# got rid of -I in includes
