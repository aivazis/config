# Revision 1.6  2002/02/21 20:07:19  cummings
# Removed the optional linking with -lgen if VTFHOST equals _lanl.
# This was needed in order to support calling mkdirp from within
# an executable to create directories for storing output files.
# This is all done from Python scripts now, so this is obsolete.
#
# Revision 1.5  2001/12/27 00:10:29  cummings
# Removed the step of adding VTF_LIBS to EXTERNAL_LIBS.  This was causing
# problems with library ordering on the link line because the VTF libraries
# would appear after the target-specific libraries such as the MPI library.
# This is no good, since the VTF libraries may depend on the MPI library
# or other "external" packages.  With this change, users need to explicitly
# add VTF_LIBS to the list of LIBRARIES on the link line in their Make.mm
# files if their applications use VTF packages.  VTF_LIBS should appear in
# front of EXTERNAL_LIBS on the link line to get the dependencies resolved.
# (Note: the ordering only matters on certain platforms, but it's best to
# get it right on all platforms.)
#
# Revision 1.4  2001/06/28 20:46:16  aivazis
# Added VTF_DEFINES from vtf.def
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/01/31 22:15:11  cummings
# Add -lgen to list of external libraries to link with
# if we are building on the LANL platform.  This library
# supports calls to mkdirp, which we use to set up
# scratch disk areas for dump files at LANL.
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/09/19 05:49:22  aivazis
# Moved VTF_xxxx macros to vtf.def
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/09/19 03:36:29  aivazis
# Added F90 modules
#

include vtf/vtf.def

#
# Adjust the external variables to include VTF stuff
#

EXTERNAL_F90_MODULES += $(VTF_F90_MODULES)

EXTERNAL_DEFINES += $(VTF_DEFINES)
EXTERNAL_INCLUDES += $(VTF_INCLUDES)

#
# End of file
